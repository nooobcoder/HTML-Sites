<p>These same six points are also true about programming. Let us take the cooking analogy
  one step further. Suppose you need to teach someone how to become a chef. How
  would you go about it? Would you first introduce the person to good food, hoping
  that a taste for good food develops? Would you have the person follow recipe after
  recipe in the hope that some of it rubs off? Or would you first teach the use of tools
  and the nature of ingredients, the foods and spices, and explain how they fit together?
  Just as there is disagreement about how to teach cooking, there is disagreement about
  how to teach programming.
  Learning a programming language is like learning to become a chef or learning to play
  a musical instrument. All three require direct interaction with the tools. You cannot
  become a good chef just by reading recipes. Similarly, you cannot become a musician
  by reading books about musical instruments. The same is true of programming. You
  must have a fundamental knowledge of the language, and you must test your programs
  on the computer to make sure that each program does what it is supposed to do.</p>

	<h2 id="topic2"><mark>The Basics of a C++ Program</mark></h2>
<p> In the previous section, we gave an example of a C11 program and also identified
  certain parts of the program. In general, a C11 program is a collection of one or
  more subprograms, called functions. Roughly speaking, a subprogram or a function
  is a collection of statements, and when it is activated, or executed, it accomplishes
  something. Some functions, called predefined or standard functions, are already

  written and are provided as part of the system. But to accomplish most tasks, programmers
  must learn to write their own functions.
  Every C11 program has a function called main. Thus, if a C11 program has only
  one function, it must be the function main. Until Chapter 6, other than using some
  of the predefined functions, you will mainly deal with the function main. By the end
  of this chapter, you will have learned how to write programs consisting only of the
  function main.
  If you have never seen a program written in a programming language, the C11 program
  in Example 2-1 may look like a foreign language. To make meaningful sentences
  in a foreign language, you must learn its alphabet, words, and grammar. The same is
  true of a programming language. To write meaningful programs, you must learn the
  programming language’s special symbols, words, and syntax rules. The syntax rules
  tell you which statements (instructions) are legal or valid, that is, which are accepted
  by the programming language and which are not. You must also learn semantic rules,
  which determine the meaning of the instructions. The programming language’s rules,
  symbols, and special words enable you to write programs to solve problems.
  Programming language: A set of rules, symbols, and special words.
  In the remainder of this section, you will learn about some of the special symbols of
  a C11 program. Additional special symbols are introduced as other concepts are
  encountered in later chapters. Similarly, syntax and semantic rules are introduced
  and discussed throughout the book. </p>
	<h2 id="topic3"><mark>Comments in C++</mark></h2>
<p>The program that you write should be clear not only to you, but also to the reader of
  your program. Part of good programming is the inclusion of comments in the program.
  Typically, comments can be used to identify the authors of the program, give
  the date when the program is written or modified, give a brief explanation of the
  program, and explain the meaning of key statements in a program. In the programming
  examples, for the programs that we write, we will not include the date when the
  program is written, consistent with the standard convention for writing such books.
  Comments are for the reader, not for the compiler. So when a compiler compiles a
  program to check for the syntax errors, it completely ignores comments. Throughout
  this book, comments are shown in green.
  The program in Example 2-1 contains the following comments:
  //**************************************************************
  // Given the length and width of a rectangle, this C++ program
  // computes and outputs the perimeter and area of the rectangle.
  //**************************************************************
  There are two common types of comments in a C11 program—single-line comments
  and multiple-line comments.
  2
  Single-line comments begin with // and can be placed anywhere in the line. Everything
  encountered in that line after // is ignored by the compiler. For example, consider
  the following statement:
  cout << "7 + 8 = " << 7 + 8 << endl;
  You can put comments at the end of this line as follows:
  cout << "7 + 8 = " << 7 + 8 << endl; //prints: 7 + 8 = 15
  This comment could be meaningful for a beginning programmer.
  Multiple-line comments are enclosed between /* and */. The compiler ignores anything
  that appears between /* and */. For example, the following is an example of a
  multiple-line comment:
  /*
  You can include comments that can
  occupy several lines.
  */
  In multiple-line comments, many programmers use single-line comments on every
  line to make the comments stand out more to the reader (as was done in the program
  in Example 2-1).</p>
